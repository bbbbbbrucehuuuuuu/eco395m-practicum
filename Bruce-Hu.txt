Hi guys, my name is Bruce and I'm a second year Master student in Economics. 
Before joining this practicum, I've taken Python course and Data Mining, from which I gained most of my knowledge on coding. I have several years of experience in Econometrics and Time Series Analysis, and I've also taken Causal Inference last spring, where I found great interest in those relating topics.
 I have  very little real life experience in computer science and have yet had any chances practicing any projects outside of class. With that said, I'm nervous but also excited to embrace this opportunity and learn "on the fly".
